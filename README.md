# Passman
Passman! your very own, Open Source, Jank, GUI based, password manager! It encrypts your password (jankily) and stores it in a json file, along with your unencrypted email and the platform the data is for, for your own convenience! This is my first project with python so be nice everyone.

# Important!
to use the 'forgot password?' feature, you'll need to setup your own SendInBlue Account and configure the API key in Passman.py file. USING THAT FEATURE WILL SEND THE PASSWORD OF YOUR PASSMAN ACCOUNT IN PLAIN TEXT TO YOUR EMAIL.
In future iterations, It'll let you reset the password by sending you a code instead of sending you the Passman password in plain text.
